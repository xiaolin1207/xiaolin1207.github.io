# About Me

I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU). I am lucky enough to work with Prof. [Liping Jing](http://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8249/). 

I strive for developing novel machine learning and natural language processing algorithms. In addition, I am also interested in a broad range of multi-label classification, long-tailed classification, transfer learning.
